# Examples #
A simple demonstration of a timer off function is implemented in the source file tof.cpp. In this demonstration a blower is controlled to power off 20 minutes after a light bulb switch off.

The light switching on is detected by a light sensor and the blower is controlled by a relay board.

A more elaborate example is given in full_demo.cpp source file, where different modes of operation can be selected by manoeuvring the lgiht switch (e.g. switching the light twice quickly will switch off the blower definitely).

This code is used to automate the blower(fan) operation of a WC. The micro-processor used is an Arduino nano.
